# Fortified-Cards

“Fortified Cards” is a project that envisions an entirely different perspective when it comes to performing transactions using your credit / debit card. The project uses the one of the most vital aspects of mobile computing, the IMEI number along with the one that is most used technology, the QR Code. The combination of these two concepts to help secure the day – to – day transactions is the aim of this project. In this system, the user registers the IMEI number of his or her cell-phone with the bank, which gets linked to the credit / debit card number of the user. The bank issues the user with a credit / debit card with an encrypted QR Code. At the POS, the first step involves the user scanning the QR Code on their card using the cell-phone that was initially registered with the bank with its’ IMEI number. The next step includes scanning the QR Code of the vendor, which is possibly pasted on the cashier’s desk, and finally confirming the payment once the vendor enters the due amount.
